## KNN
K-Nearest Neighbour can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. 

**Usage**: to classify the new cases based on all the available nearest neighbouring cases
**Assumptions**: 
- KNN assumes that the data is in a feature space
- meaning, the data points are in a metric space
- the data can be scalars or even multidimensional vectors 

3 important reasons to choose KNN
1. Ease of interpretation
2. Calculation time
3. Predictive power
